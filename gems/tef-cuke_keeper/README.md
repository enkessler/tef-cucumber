TEF CukeKeeper

A CukeKeeper is responsible handling the results of Cucumber tasks. Task output is stored in a database for later analysis.


Getting Started
=========

To run a Cucumber keeper, simply follow the same setup steps as a [regular keeper](https://github.com/grange-insurance/tef/blob/master/gems/tef-keeper/README.md)
and use the callback provided by this gem.
